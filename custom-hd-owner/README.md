# HdOwner (Hierarchical Deterministic Owner)

HdWallets are a commong thing in bitcoin. They are great because
they take really good care of users privacy and they can be regenerated
with a single key. They are also super flexible.

This example generates a run owner with the same properties that an hd
wallet has.
