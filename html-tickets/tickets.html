<!--
    This example demonstrates one jig creating another jig. In this case, an
    Event jig creates Ticket jigs. The ticket jigs may later be redeemd at the
    event. To run, open this page in a browser and view the developer console.

    You can interact with the clases and tickets of the example from the
    developer console.
